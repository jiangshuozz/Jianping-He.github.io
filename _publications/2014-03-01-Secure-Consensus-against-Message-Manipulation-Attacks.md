Abstract: 
===
The security problem of consensus has been attracting increasing research attention for a large number of application scenarios. Many existing solutions in this aspect rely on the assumption that most of the neighboring nodes of each safe node are honest which may not be able to satisfy various practical situations. Motivated by a recent work dealing with the secure consensus for time synchronization in asynchronous networks, this paper aims to handle secure synchronous consensusunder message manipulation attacks. Specifically, we first propose a secure synchronous consensusalgorithm(SSCA), and prove that SSCA converges with an exponential rate through matrix analysis.Furthermore, we investigate how the exact behavior of message manipulation attack will affect the convergence of SSCA. Specifically, we show how such result can be employed to classify the attack behavior and help analyze the consensus performance. Examples and extensive simulations are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed results.
