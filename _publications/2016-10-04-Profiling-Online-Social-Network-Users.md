Abstract:  
===  
Research on individuals in online social networks often requires the collection of personal information such as demographics. Due to both user privacy concerns and unformatted textual information, it is quite difficult to build a completely labeled social network directly. However, both social relations and network characteristics can help attribute inference to profile online social network users. In this paper, we propose several attribute inference models based on these two factors and implement them with Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Also, to study network characteristics and evaluate the performance of our proposed models, we use a well-labeled Google employee social network extracted from Google+ to test the proposed models on inferring the social roles of Google employees. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in social role inference with Dyadic Label Model performing best.
