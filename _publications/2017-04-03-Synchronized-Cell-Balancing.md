Abstract: 
===
As a classical cell balancing solution in low-power supercapacitor applications, the switched resistor circuit is vulnerable to resistance deviation effects with existing cell balancing methods. In this paper, we propose a synchronized cell balancing method for switched resistor circuits based on the consensus theory and a cyber-physical approach, with the aim of synchronizing cell voltages before they are fully charged. It is shown that the proposed cell-balancing algorithm is robust to resistance deviation effects. Extensive simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
