Abstract:
===
Privacy-preserving data aggregation in network systems, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), is a challenging problem, considering the dynamic network topology, limited computing capacity and energy supply of IoT devices, etc. The difficulty is exaggerated when there exist dishonest nodes, and how to ensure privacy, accuracy, and robustness of the data aggregation process against dishonest nodes remains an open issue. Different from the widely investigated cryptographic approaches, in this paper, we address this challenging problem by exploiting the distributed consensus technique. To mitigate the pollution from dishonest nodes, we propose an enhanced secure consensus-based data aggregation (E-SCDA) algorithm that allows neighbors to detect dishonest nodes, and derive the error bound when there are undetectable dishonest nodes. We prove the convergence of the E-SCDA and show that the algorithm can preserve the privacy associated to nodesâ€™ initial states. Extensive simulations have shown that the proposed algorithm has a high convergence accuracy and low complexity, even when there exist dishonest nodes in the network.
