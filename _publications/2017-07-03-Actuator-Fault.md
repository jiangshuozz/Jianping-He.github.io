Abstract: 
===
Actuator fault of a multicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) may lead to a dangerous flight, and even damage the UAV. To ensure the flight safety in case of unpredictable actuator fault, many active fault tolerant control methods are studied in the last decade. An active fault tolerant method of a multicopter includes a fault detection, isolation and reconstruction (FDIR) scheme and a control allocation scheme. FDIR is of great importance for providing the estimation of the efficiency loss percentage. Previous FDIR procedures usually rely on an observer, which is complicated and computationally expensive. In this paper, we exploit the non-linear analytical redundancy techniques to provide a novel FDIR procedure, with a simple algorithm structure. We compare the isolation effectiveness and reconstruction performance of our approach and sliding mode observer based approach by a real experiment, respectively. It demonstrates that our approach shows a superiority of simpler algorithm structure and better fault reconstruction performance.
