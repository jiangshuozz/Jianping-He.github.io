Abstract:  
===  
This paper studies the scheduling of multiple Electric Vehicles' (EVs) charging with service quality constraint at a workplace charging station, aiming to maximize the profit of the charging station under time- of-use (TOU) pricing. We develop a multi-charger framework considering both the customers' and charging station's interests. First, an admission control mechanism is proposed to guarantee that all admitted EVs' charging requirements can be satisfied before their departure time. Then, under the premise of declining the customers' requirements as little as possible, a Joint Searching (JS) scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the profit of the charging station. Extensive simulations based on realistic EV charging information and TOU pricing have been conducted. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in terms of up to 30% profit and similar service declining probability.
