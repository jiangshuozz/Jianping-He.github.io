Abstract: 
===
Protecting location privacy of mobile systems is
important for various location-based services in pervasive computing
scenarios. How to quickly compute the target user’s
location without knowing each anchor user’s location has drawn
much attention. Under the classical nonadjacent subtraction
based localization model, existing solutions based on homomophic
encryption introduce much computation and communication
overheads to achieve privacy-preserving localization. In this paper,
an adjacent subtraction based localization model is proposed,
which is suitable to efficiently protect users’ privacy. Then,
under such a model, an efficient privacy-preserving localization
algorithm is developed without using homomophic encryption. A
closed-form expression of the relationship between the localization
error and the measurement noise is derived. Furthermore,
a comprehensive analysis, including correctness analysis, privacy
analysis, and efficiency analysis, is presented. Some simulations
are conducted to show that the proposed model has equivalent
accuracy and efficiency with the classical model. Some numerical
results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed
privacy-preserving localization algorithm.
