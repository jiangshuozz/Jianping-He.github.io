Abstract:  
===  
GPS is of great importance for autopilot of an Unmanned Aerial Vehilce (UAV). Recently, GPS spoofing attack on UAV has attracted widespread research interests due to the vulnerability of civilian GPS signal. This paper specifies a scenario in which the GPS spoofing attacker intends to drive the UAV equipped with a fault detector to any arbitrary destination without triggering the detector. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem, and provide an effective solution to compute the falsified GPS measurement of each time instant. In addition, we analyze and compute the largest attainable location set of the UAV under GPS spoofing attack, which quantifies the capability of GPS Spoofing attack under the constraint of the fault detector. Numerical simulations under various parameter settings are conducted to verify the results.
