Abstract:
===
For vehicular networks, dropboxes are very useful for assisting the data dissemination, as they can greatly increase the contact probabilities between vehicles and reduce the data delivery delay. However, due to the costly deployment of dropboxes, it is impractical to deploy dropboxes in a dense manner. In this paper, we investigate how to deploy the dropboxes optimally by considering the tradeoff between the delivery delay and the cost of dropbox deployment. This is a very challenging issue due to the difficulty of accurate delay estimation and the complexity of solving the optimization problem. To address this issue, we first provide a theoretical framework to estimate the delivery delay accurately. Then, based on the idea of dimension enlargement and dynamic programming, we design a novel optimal dropbox deployment algorithm (ODDA) to obtain the optimal deployment strategy. We prove that ODDA has a fast convergence speed, which is less than κ (κ <; n) iterations for convergence. We also prove that the computational complexity of ODDA is O(nkm logm), i.e., ODDA has a polynomial computational complexity for a given m, the number of dropboxes for deployment. Performance evaluation by simulation demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed strategies compared with the benchmark methods.
