Abstract:  
===  
Future hybrid vehicle networks can use both Vehicle-to- Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications to provide reliable, timely, scalable, and media-rich services. In this paper, we investigate the problem that how to disseminate the data to the Road Side Unit (RSU) considering bidirectional transmissions, using vehicles to store-carry-and-forward the messages if possible, in hybrid V2I/V2V networks. We focus on the delay modeling and dissemination strategy design, aiming to minimize the delivery delay. Considering a one-dimensional vehicle network with multiple road segments, we model the process of uploading a message to an RSU either in front of or behind the source. Furthermore, based on the delay analysis, we obtain the desirable message dissemination direction, and further design the message uploading algorithm to minimize the expected deliver delay. Simulations have been conducted to verify the correctness of the analysis and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The analytical model can also provide important insights and guideline for the deployment of RSUs.
