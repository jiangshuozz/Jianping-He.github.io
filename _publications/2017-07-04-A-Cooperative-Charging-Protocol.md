Abstract: 
===
Catenary-free trams with an onboard supercapacitor
have been an emerging and energy-efficient way for urban
rail transportation. However, the high-power charging load from
catenary-free trams brings a new challenge to the design of
charging systems. The traditional single-module charging system
typically suffers from a high power and thermal pressure, which
reduces the reliability of the charging system. In this paper,
we propose a multimodule charging system to improve the system
reliability by decomposing power pressure to multiple charging
modules. Specifically, a cooperative charging protocol is proposed
to improve the dynamic performance of the charging system
by suppressing the current imbalance and avoiding the current
overshoot during the startup process. First, we mathematically
model the multimodule charging system using the state-space
averaging method and graph theory. Second, the cooperative
charging protocol is designed using the leaderâ€“follower consensus
algorithm, where the virtual leader represents the desired
charging current for each module with a warm-start mechanism.
Third, multiple-input multiple-output root locus technique is
exploited to characterize the dynamic performance of the charging
system. Both simulation and experiment results show that
the proposed protocol effectively suppresses the imbalance and
avoids the overshoot during the startup of the charging system.
